- Ensured that the code performance included more than **90% coverage in unit tests** and had sufficient capacity to handle the expected user load. Rigorous unit testing was conducted to achieve over 90% code coverage, ensuring robustness and reliability under varying user loads.
  <br></br>
- Develop a batch process using **Golang**, implementing **Goroutines** for concurrent operations. Utilized **cronjobs** to trigger the batch at scheduled intervals. Developed a batch processing system in Golang, leveraging Goroutines for concurrent processing, and scheduled its execution using cronjobs for efficient and automated task execution.
  <br></br>
- Develop an internal library for specific use cases, such as **logging request and response data** when communicating with external services. Created a reusable library to facilitate logging of request and response data during interactions with external services, enhancing debugging and monitoring capabilities.
  <br></br>
- **Migrating** a legacy service from Node.js to Golang, enhancing performance and reducing operational costs.
